					vendors. The race is on to enhance product offerings and consolidate these key 
					features for use by large and small hospitals: 

Meaningful use (MU2/3) proof and adoption 
ICD-10 conversion 
Consolidation of EHR databases across products 
HIE integration with regional and national networks; Only a few in the industry will capture the emerging national market by harnessing these elements:

								 
								Innovative software talent 
								Quick and smart delivery 
								The latest in social, mobile, analytics and cloud computing (SMAC) technologies
